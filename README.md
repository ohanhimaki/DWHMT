Data Warehouse Modeling App: Documentation and Plan
I. Introduction

This document outlines the plan and basic documentation for a web application designed to assist users in modeling data warehouse layers, specifically transitioning from a "source" (initially provided by the user) to a "target" layer. The application will allow users to input source table metadata, define target tables by mapping source columns, and export the target schema in various formats.

II. User Workflow

Source Data Input:

Upon opening the application with a fresh project, the user is presented with an input area.
The user is expected to paste tabular data with the following columns (in any order, but the application should guide the user on the expected format):
TableName (Name of the source table)
ColumnName (Name of the column in the source table)
ExampleData (A sample value or a comma-separated list of sample values for the column)
RowCount (Total number of rows in the source table)
UniqueCount (Number of unique values in the source column)
NullCount (Number of null values in the source column)
The data is expected to be tab-separated, with each row representing a column in a source table. The first row should be headers.
The application will parse this data to create an internal representation of the source tables and their columns with associated metadata.
Source Table and Column Listing:

After successful parsing, the application will display a list of the identified source tables.
For each source table, users can view its columns and the associated metadata (example data, row count, unique count, null count).
The UI should allow users to easily browse and understand the structure and characteristics of their source data.
Target Table Definition and Mapping:

Users can create new "target" tables.
For each target table, users can define columns.
The core functionality here is the ability to map source columns to target columns. This will involve:
Selecting a source table and a source column.
Specifying a name for the target column (which can be the same or different from the source column name).
Adding optional comments or descriptions for the target column.
Potentially defining data type transformations (this can be a future enhancement).
The UI should provide a clear way to visualize these mappings.
Target Export:

Excel Export: Users should be able to export the defined target table schemas (table names, column names, and potentially descriptions/comments) to an Excel file.
Direct SQL Queries: The application should be able to generate basic SQL CREATE TABLE statements for the defined target tables, potentially including column names and basic data types (which might be inferred or user-defined in a future enhancement).
Project Export/Import (JSON):

Export: Users can export the entire project as a JSON file. This file should contain:
The raw source data (as it was input).
The internal representation of the source tables and their metadata.
The definitions of the target tables, including their columns and the mappings to the source columns.
Any additional project-level settings or metadata.
Import (Future Enhancement): While not explicitly in the initial usage, the plan should consider the ability to import a previously exported JSON project to resume work.
III. Technical Plan (Blazor with MudBlazor)

Given your choice of Blazor with MudBlazor, here's a high-level technical plan:

Project Setup: Ensure you have a Blazor WebAssembly or Blazor Server project set up with the MudBlazor NuGet package installed and configured.

Data Models (C# Classes):

SourceColumnInfo: Represents a single column from the input source data with properties for TableName, ColumnName, ExampleData (likely a string), RowCount (int), UniqueCount (int), and NullCount (int).
SourceTable: Represents a source table, containing a TableName and a List<SourceColumnInfo>.
TargetColumn: Represents a column in a target table with properties for TargetTableName, TargetColumnName, SourceTableName (nullable), SourceColumnName (nullable), and Comment (string).
TargetTable: Represents a target table with a TargetTableName and a List<TargetColumn>.
DataWarehouseProject: A container class to hold List<SourceTable> and List<TargetTable>, and potentially project-level metadata.
Blazor Components and Pages:

Pages/InputSourceData.razor:
A page with a MudTextField for pasting the source data.
Logic to parse the tab-separated data into a List<SourceColumnInfo> and then group them into List<SourceTable>.
Display any parsing errors to the user.
A button to trigger the parsing process and navigate to the next step.
Pages/ViewSourceData.razor:
A page to display the list of SourceTable objects.
Use MudExpansionPanel or a similar component to show the columns and their metadata for each table.
Pages/DefineTargetTables.razor:
A page where users can:
Add new TargetTable objects.
For each TargetTable, add new TargetColumn objects.
Implement a mechanism (e.g., dropdowns or a drag-and-drop interface) to map a SourceColumnInfo to a TargetColumn.
Allow users to rename target columns and add comments.
Pages/ExportTarget.razor:
A page with options to export the List<TargetTable>:
Excel Export: Use a library like NPOI or ClosedXML to generate an Excel file.
SQL Export: Generate CREATE TABLE statements as text that the user can copy.
Potentially a main project page (/) to guide the user through the workflow.
State Management: For a simple application, you might manage state within the Blazor components using @code blocks and properties. For a more complex application, consider a state management library like Fluxor or a scoped service to share data between components (especially the source data and target definitions).

JSON Serialization/Deserialization: Use System.Text.Json to implement the project export and (future) import functionality for the DataWarehouseProject object.

IV. Detailed Feature Breakdown

1. Source Data Input (InputSourceData.razor)

UI: MudTextField for pasting. MudButton to process. MudAlert for error messages.
Logic:
Split pasted text by newline.
Read the first line as headers.
For each subsequent line, split by tab.
Map the values to the properties of SourceColumnInfo based on the headers. Handle potential errors (missing columns, incorrect data types).
Group SourceColumnInfo objects by TableName to create SourceTable objects.
Store the parsed List<SourceTable> in a state that can be accessed by other components.
Navigation to ViewSourceData.razor upon successful parsing.
2. View Source Data (ViewSourceData.razor)

UI: MudList or MudExpansionPanel to display SourceTable names. Inside each, a MudTable to show SourceColumnInfo properties (ColumnName, ExampleData, RowCount, UniqueCount, NullCount).
3. Define Target Tables (DefineTargetTables.razor)

UI:
Button to add a new TargetTable.
For each TargetTable:
MudTextField for TargetTableName.
Button to add a new TargetColumn.
For each TargetColumn:
Dropdown or selection mechanism to choose a SourceTable and SourceColumnName to map from.
MudTextField for TargetColumnName.
MudTextField for Comment.
Visual representation of the mappings (e.g., a list or a more visual diagram in a future enhancement).
Logic:
Maintain a List<TargetTable> in the component's state.
Methods to add new target tables and columns.
Logic to handle the mapping between source and target columns.
4. Export Target (ExportTarget.razor)

UI: Buttons for "Export to Excel" and "Export to SQL".
Logic:
Excel: Iterate through List<TargetTable>. Create a new worksheet for each table. Write headers (Target Column Name, Comment). Write rows for each TargetColumn. Use a library for Excel generation.
SQL: Iterate through List<TargetTable>. For each table, generate a CREATE TABLE statement with the TargetTableName and TargetColumnName. Basic data types might need to be assumed (e.g., VARCHAR(255) for all initially, with potential future enhancements for data type mapping).
5. Project Export/Import (MainLayout.razor or a dedicated page)

UI: Buttons for "Export Project (JSON)" and (future) "Import Project (JSON)".
Logic:
Export: Create a DataWarehouseProject object containing the current List<SourceTable> and List<TargetTable>. Serialize this object to a JSON string using System.Text.Json. Offer the user a download of the JSON file.
Import (Future): Allow the user to upload a JSON file. Deserialize the JSON string back into a DataWarehouseProject object and populate the application's state.
V. Future Enhancements

Data Type Mapping: Allow users to specify or infer data types for target columns.
More Advanced Transformations: Implement the ability to define simple transformations (e.g., concatenation, basic calculations) during the mapping.
Visual Mapping Interface: Instead of dropdowns, use a drag-and-drop interface to visualize the mapping between source and target columns.
Database Connection and Metadata Browsing: Instead of manual pasting, allow users to connect to source databases and browse their schemas directly.
Gold Layer Modeling: Extend the application to support the definition and mapping for a "gold" (aggregated/reporting) layer.
Reverse Engineering: The ability to import existing target database schemas to visualize and further model them.
Collaboration: Features for multiple users to work on the same project.
VI. Conclusion

This plan provides a solid starting point for developing your data warehouse modeling application. By focusing on the core user workflow and iteratively adding features, you can build a valuable tool for your needs. Remember to prioritize user experience and provide clear feedback throughout the application. Good luck!
